# GeoAnnotateAssisted
client-server python app for labeling climate data with some fancy labels

GeoAnnotateAssisted is an extension of the client-only labeling app [GeoAnnotate](https://github.com/MKrinitskiy/GeoAnnotate) for climate problems.

Originally it was forked from https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg

Modifications were made in order to fit the current problem requirements:

- Labels of an elliptic form;
- Source data in NetCDF format which have to be projected;
- Various scales of this projection.

Client-server version was developed in order to address low performance of client-side PC.
